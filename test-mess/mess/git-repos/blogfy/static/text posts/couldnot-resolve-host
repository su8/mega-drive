<p>So you just did a brand new installation or re-installation of CentOS and tried to update the distro via <code>yum update</code>, but faced <strong>"Couldn't resolve host 'mirrorlist.centos.org'" Error: Cannot find a valid baseurl for repo: base</strong> Let's find how to fix it.</p>

<p>Making sure that all network interfaces are up and runnig</p>

<pre>ifconfig
<p>ping google.com</p></pre>

<p>What is telling you the ping - uknown host ? How many NICs do you see from the ifconfig output? I see just one named 'lo'. Let's edit eth0 and make it up and running.</p>

<pre>vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0</pre>

<p>Make sure to change <strong>ONBOOT=no</strong> to <strong>ONBOOT=yes</strong>, edit another file to add your gateway:</p>

<pre>vi /etc/sysconfig/network</pre>

<p>Add on the bottom: <strong>GATEWAY=192.168.10.20</strong>, replace the ip with yours. Last file to edit - the dns resolver:</p>

<pre>vi /etc/resolv.conf</pre>

<p>Include google public dns servers IP</p>

<pre>nameserver 8.8.8.8
<p>nameserver 8.8.4.4</p></pre>

<p>Almost done, just restart the network and everything will be up and running after few seconds: <code>service network restart</code></p>
